This application provides a complete toolkit for training, evaluating, and deploying
log anomaly detection models based on the LogLLM architecture, optimized for
resource-constrained environments.

**Navigate using the sidebar to:**
- **Train & Evaluate:** Launch a new training run with custom models and datasets.
- **View History:** Review detailed reports and metrics from past training runs.
- **Inference:** Perform real-time anomaly detection on log sequences.

# --- Instructions for setup ---
st.info("""
**Getting Started:**
1.  Ensure you have placed your datasets in the `datasets/` directory. Each dataset should have its own folder (e.g., `datasets/BGL/`) containing `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
2.  Pre-downloaded models can be placed in the `models/` directory.
3.  Use the `run_training.py` script for command-line training or use the **Train & Evaluate** page to start a run from the UI.
